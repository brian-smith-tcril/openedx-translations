openedx-translations
####################

The openedx-translations repository contains translation files from Open edX repositories
to be kept in sync with Transifex. To accomplish this task, a GitHub Action in
`.github/workflows/` named `extract-translation-source-files.yml` regularly extracts
English translation source files form Open edX repositories containing code and adds them
to this repository. A GitHub Transifex app allows for the automatic upload of these
translation files and after being translated on Transifex, the automatic download back
into this repository. The translation files in this repository can then be accessed by
using the `openedx-atlas`_ CLI tool to download specific directories of translation files
from openedx-translations.

Current State
*************

This repository is currently a prototype and offers limited capability. The GitHub Action
`extract-translation-source-files.yml` generates English translation source files for
only one repository `openedx/credentials`. These translation source files are the only
ones uploaded to the Transifex project openedx-translations. The English translation
source files have only been translated into one language: French Canadian (fr_CA). The
`openedx-atlas`_ CLI tool can only be used to pull translation files from the credentials
directory in openedx-translations.
